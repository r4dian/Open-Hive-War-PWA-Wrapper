1 Open Hive War PWA Wrapper
═══════════════════════════

1.1 What
────────

  This app can be used to generate a scenario for the Games Workshop
  game Necromunda.

        Across the blackened industrial hives, gangs continually
        fight for the control of territories, Enforcers fight to
        execute the rule of law and the tentacles of insidious
        cults worm their way through the populace. It is a world
        where the most that anyone can hope for is survival, and
        so it has bred people who are true survivors.

  Just wraps an iframe containing *openhivewar.com* with the metadata
  needed to make it a “Progressive Web App”

  *The “Buy me a coffee” button is for the original author(s?) of
   openhivewar.com*, no theft of labour going on here thank you.


1.2 Why
───────

  Install it on your phone & it opens as if it were a full app instead
  of opening your browser & it (or you) getting lost among the tabs.

  Visit [this live version hosted on surge.sh] to install it (if you
  like).


  …That’s about it.
