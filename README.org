* Open Hive War PWA Wrapper

** What 
#+begin_quote
Across the blackened industrial hives, gangs continually fight for the control of territories, Enforcers fight to execute the rule of law and the tentacles of insidious cults worm their way through the populace. It is a world where the most that anyone can hope for is survival, and so it has bred people who are true survivors. 
#+end_quote

Just wraps an iframe containing *openhivewar.com* with the metadata needed to make it a "Progressive Web App"

This app can be used to generate a scenario for the Games Workshop game Necromunda.

** Why
Install it on your phone & it opens as if it were a full app instead of opening your browser & it (or you) getting lost among the tabs.

Visit [[https://andys-installable-open-hive-war.surge.sh/][this hosted version]] to install it (if you like).


...That's about it.
